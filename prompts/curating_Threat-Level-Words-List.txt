I am building a cyber threat dataset and need a small set of words that express the severity or threat level of a cyberattack. These words should reflect urgency, danger, or criticality in the context of cybersecurity communications (e.g., incident reports, alerts, threat intelligence posts). Please provide no more than 10 keywords that are commonly used to signal high threat levels.
