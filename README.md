# A Self-Training-Based Annotation Framework with Tailored Augmentation for Cyber Threat Intelligence Posts

This repository contains two datasets curated for the paper **"A Self-Training-Based Annotation Framework with Tailored Augmentation for Cyber Threat Intelligence Posts."**

## Included Files
- `CTI-sample-dataset-ids-only.csv`: Manually cross-annotated CTI-Annotated Sample Dataset  
- `CTI-full-dataset-ids-only.csv`: Automatically annotated CTI-Annotated Full Dataset generated via self-training
- `unlabeled_data_ids.csv`: Unlabeled data used to generate the CTI-Annotated Full Dataset (shared for reproducibility purposes)

## Description
Each dataset contains post IDs from the social media platform **X** and their corresponding labels. Labels are:
- `CTI-Positive`: Post is related to cyber threat intelligence (CTI)
- `CTI-Negative`: Post is not related to CTI
